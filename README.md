# mgla_img_analysis_pipeline
Standard pipeline I use to analyze my microglial images. Usually, these images are maximum intensity projections that contain multiple channels, 1 channel which is IBA1 (specific microglia marker used for cell counts) and other channels that contain stains for homeostatic or other microglial proteins (e.g. TMEM119, P2YR12 etc.)
